# ReaperTimecodeExport

A small python script to convert the csv files exported from Reaper to a xml format the MA understands - only tested on MA2

# ONLY USE TIMESTAMPS IN HH:MM:SS:Frame with 30 FPS

you can configure stuff by hand but i just throw it togehther that it worked

usage: ReaperTimecodExport.py [filename with .csv]

You need to have a folder named 'importexport' and 'macros' in the same folder as the script
